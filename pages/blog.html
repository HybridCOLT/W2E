                            Hi, I am about to complete one year since I decided to learn web development by myself (well, using online resources including videos). I decided to learn mostly because I wanted to build the website for my own business.

                            The journey has been far from pretty. I have had many phases of self-doubt, went through tutorial hell, javascript fatigue. I even gave up for a month but then started again. Finally, tens of tutorial videos, frantic googling, inefficient StackOverflow exploration and almost a year later, I am just starting to get somewhat confident about my abilities to build full-stack projects from scratch. Even now, I often feel inadequate lots of times.

                            I feel that it is important to put our struggles out there so that others going through the same can keep motivated and learn from our mistakes and maybe from our solutions as well. I also intend to build products that can help with the entire journey if I find some glaring problems that can be fixed.
