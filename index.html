                    Here is some stuff you absolutely need to know about me, you'll be tested on this later on. I like video games, and would like to branch off into video game programming if I manage to see this course through to the end. I am honestly not learning web development, considering how far back I am in the class, but I guess it is possible to comeback from this... I hope.
